/**
 * A implementation of a basic smart contract in Corda.
 *
 * This contract enforces rules regarding the creation of a valid [IOUState], which in turn encapsulates an [IOUState].
 *
 * For a new [IOUState] to be issued onto the ledger, a transaction is required which takes:
 * - Zero input states.
 * - One output state: the new [IOUState].
 * - An Create() command with the public keys of both the lender and the borrower.
 *
 * All contracts must sub-class the [Contract] interface.
